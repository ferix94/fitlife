<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<p> I have always participated in sports from a young age. My favourites are basketball, Aikido and weight lifting.</p>
<p> I compete in body building competions and currently I rank number 7 in the country in my category.</p>
<p> Through these challenges, I have gained a lot of experience with improving myself, particularly when it comes to 
    having a healthy diet, workout schedule, mental toughness and displine. </p>
<p>If you are looking to better yourself mentally and physically, then you have come to the right place!!</p>
